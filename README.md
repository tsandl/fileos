# Fileos
 a simple file system is based on ext and using c++.It is comfortable for linux.

*filesystem-1.0.tar.gz* is the better version of all.I write a simple makefile in it just for compiling easily.

## Fn directory filesytem

 the architecture of this file system is like the following picture.But i lack of group descriptors and Reserved GDT block.
